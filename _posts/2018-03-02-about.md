Are you working or studying at a university in Belgium, The Netherlands, or Luxembourg in the field of magnetic resonance in medicine?
Interested in learning about open science practices and tools and how to apply them in your research?
Want to meet likeminded students and researchers and discuss challenges and ideas?


Come to the OpenMR Benelux event in Leiden! This 1-day event has been scheduled to lead up to the annual meeting of the [ISMRM Benelux chapter](http://www.ismrm-benelux.org/) on 17 January 2019, thus adding to the community experience. 

Our goal is to welcome attendees from any background (technical or clinical), and discuss topics related to open science practices in magnetic resonance imaging in medicine, including open tools for machine learning applications in MRI; data and code sharing practices; the role of mentoring in facilitating academic careers; the future of open access publishing.
